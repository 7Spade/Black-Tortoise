feat(architecture): enforce DDD event sourcing rules per PR comment 3796241037

BREAKING CHANGE: Event publishing architecture strictly enforced

This commit enforces the constitution-mandated event architecture rules:

1. **Deleted orphaned event.store.ts**
   - Violated append-before-publish (used Promise.all for parallel execution)
   - Never imported or used anywhere
   - Responsibility already covered by PublishEventUseCase

2. **Enhanced PublishEventUseCase validation**
   - Added timestamp Date instance validation
   - Added causationId type validation (string | null)
   - Ensures DomainEvent interface compliance

3. **Implemented causality propagation (QCFailed → IssueCreated)**
   - Moved issue creation from presentation to application event handler
   - Proper causality chain: correlationId inherited, causationId = parent.eventId
   - Full event traceability for distributed debugging

4. **Removed direct issue creation from presentation layer**
   - tasks.module.ts no longer orchestrates cross-module workflows
   - Presentation only dispatches commands to use cases
   - Workflows handled by application event handlers

5. **Fixed base-module event publishing violation**
   - Removed publishModuleInitialized call from presentation
   - Presentation modules subscribe only, never publish

6. **Enforced EventStore immutability and replay safety**
   - Events frozen (Object.freeze) on append
   - Query methods return defensive copies
   - Replay-safe: state reconstruction guaranteed

7. **Created architecture lock documentation**
   - .architectural-rules.md defines forbidden imports
   - Provides verification commands
   - Documents event publishing and causality rules

Constitution Compliance:
- ✅ All events published via PublishEventUseCase only
- ✅ Append-before-publish enforced (sequential)
- ✅ DomainEvent interface matches constitution
- ✅ EventStore append-only, immutable, replay-safe
- ✅ Causality propagation implemented
- ✅ Presentation locked from EventBus/EventStore
- ✅ No orphaned stores
- ✅ No RxJS, no TODOs, no abstractions beyond required

Verification:
- No forbidden EventBus/EventStore imports in presentation
- No direct publish/append outside PublishEventUseCase
- All stores in application layer
