# Header Unification Fix - Verification Checklist

## Code Changes
[✓] Removed WorkspaceSwitcherContainerComponent (duplicate with selector conflict)
[✓] Updated HeaderComponent to import WorkspaceSwitcherComponent from features/workspace
[✓] Updated barrel exports in workspace-switcher/index.ts
[✓] Verified no remaining references to removed component

## Build & Compilation
[✓] TypeScript AOT build passes (npm run build)
[✓] TypeScript strict type checking passes (npx tsc --noEmit)
[✓] No new compilation errors introduced
[✓] Production build bundle created successfully

## DDD Architecture Compliance
[✓] Domain layer has no framework imports
[✓] Application layer manages state via stores/facades
[✓] Infrastructure layer implements domain interfaces
[✓] Presentation layer consumes facades only
[✓] No reverse dependencies introduced
[✓] Layer boundaries respected per .github/skills/ddd/SKILL.md

## State Management
[✓] WorkspaceSwitcherComponent has ZERO local signals
[✓] WorkspaceSwitcherComponent has ZERO computed signals

[✓] All state sourced from WorkspaceFacade
[✓] Single source of truth maintained (WorkspaceContextStore)

## Component Structure
[✓] Unique selector (no conflicts)
[✓] Proper dependency injection
[✓] Zone-less architecture (signal-based)
[✓] OnPush change detection
[✓] Angular 20 control flow (@if, @for)

## Reactive Architecture
