/**
 * Event Metadata Module
 * 
 * Layer: Domain
 * Purpose: This file is deprecated. Event metadata is now embedded in event payloads.
 * 
 * The DomainEvent interface no longer has a separate metadata field.
 * Event-specific metadata should be part of the payload type.

// This file is kept for backward compatibility during migration
// but all exports are deprecated and will be removed
